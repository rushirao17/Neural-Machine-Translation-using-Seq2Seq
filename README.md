# Neural Machine Translation using Seq2Seq

### **About the Project**
This project implements a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** model using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with LSTM layers. The model translates English sentences into Marathi, showcasing the power of deep learning in natural language processing (NLP).

---

## **Features**
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** Utilizes LSTM-based encoder and decoder layers for efficient sequence learning.
- **Embeddings with Masking:** Handles padding tokens with `mask_zero=True` in embedding layers.
- **Tokenization:** Supports token-level embeddings for input and output sequences.
- **Custom Training and Inference:** Built-in decoding function to generate translations step-by-step.
- **Language Pair:** English to Marathi translation.

### Encoder:
- Embedding layer for input sequences.
- LSTM to encode input into context vectors (hidden and cell states).

### Decoder:
- Embedding layer for target sequences.
- LSTM unrolling step-by-step with input from previous states.
- Dense layer with softmax activation for predicting the next token.

## **Output Example**
The model successfully translates English sentences into Marathi. Below is an example of the output:

| **Input (English)**      | **Output (Marathi)**       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
